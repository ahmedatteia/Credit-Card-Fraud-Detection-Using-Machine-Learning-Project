# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Project

Completed a project focused on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning. This project addresses critical issue of fraud in credit card systems by utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and risks. As business complexity increases, these models adapt to identify fraud activities and recognize strange transaction patterns. The project explores various machine learning models to determine most effective one for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
